Prompt:
```
A highly - detailed, photorealistic portrait of a fierce dwarf warrior gripping a massive maul hammer with an oversized head, masterfully rendered in a digital painting medium, capturing the essence of Greg Rutkowski's signature style. The lighting features strong, directional light from above, casting dramatic shadows on the dwarf's face and hammer. The rich, earthy color palette is complemented by accents of metallic silver and gold on the maul hammer. The composition showcases an intense close - up shot, focusing on the dwarf's face and the disproportionately large head of the hammer, evoking a sense of power and determination. --ar 16:9 --v 5 --seed 1315556628 --s 250
